# AI-Based Hackathon Preparation Timeline

Preparing for an ML competition can be quite challenging, requiring attention to detail and a systematic approach. Below is a detailed timeline outlining how one might prepare for an AI-based hackathon over the course of one month.

## Days 1-3

The initial phase involves thoroughly analyzing the problem statement and sourcing the appropriate dataset. This step is critical as the success of the project hinges on the quality and reliability of the data. If a suitable dataset is not readily available, time must be allocated for data collection, a process that can be tedious and time-consuming. Assuming publicly available datasets are utilized, the quality of the data must be assessed. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other dimensionality reduction methods should be applied if applicable. Additionally, handling missing values and outliers is essential. For text or multimedia data, embedding techniques may be necessary. By the end of this phase, it is ideal to have selected 3-4 datasets, with one chosen for immediate use and the others kept as backups.

## Days 4-10

During this period, focus shifts to data preprocessing and model selection. Data preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for modeling. For tabular data, this may involve handling outliers and missing values. For non-tabular data like text or multimedia, embedding techniques are applied. Following data preprocessing, multiple models should be tested on a small sample of the dataset to identify the most suitable ones. The choice of models depends on factors such as the type of problem (supervised/unsupervised, classification/regression) and the nature of the data. By the end of this phase, 2-3 promising models should be identified.

## Days 10-15

With the models selected, the next step is to train them on the entire dataset. This phase can be computationally intensive and time-consuming, depending on the dataset size and model complexity. Experimentation is key to finding the optimal parameters for each model.

## Days 15-20

After training the models, it's time to evaluate their performance. This involves analyzing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Adjustments may need to be made to the models, such as dropping unimportant features or fine-tuning hyperparameters, to improve performance. This process is iterative, requiring multiple rounds of training and evaluation.

## Days 20-25

During this phase, focus shifts to hyperparameter tuning and refining the selected model further. The goal is to achieve the best possible performance before the final submission.

## Days 25-30

The final days are reserved for any last-minute adjustments or unforeseen delays. It's essential to have a buffer period to accommodate unexpected challenges that may arise.

By following this timeline, participants can effectively prepare for an AI-based hackathon, maximizing their chances of success.
